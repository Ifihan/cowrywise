Task for Cowrywise's application.

## **Steps to run API**

1. Clone the repository.
2. cd into the cloned repository.
3. Run the following command: `pipenv shell`. It would create a virtual envionment for the API.
4. Next up, run the command `pipenv install`. It would install all the dependencies.
5. Run the command `python manage.py runserver`. It would run the API.

Your API would be up and running at port `127.0.0.1:8000/`. Head over to the `uuid/` endpoint to see the UUID.

Thanks :)
